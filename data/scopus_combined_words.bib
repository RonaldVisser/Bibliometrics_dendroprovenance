	abstract = {The current study presents the results of the first dendrochronological survey performed over the East Aegean island of Symi. Research Highlights: Dendrochronological research of the East Aegean region is of paramount importance since dendrochronological data from the region, and especially the islands, are still limited. Background and Objectives: The main aim of the study is to explore the dendrochronological potential of the island, focusing on the dating of historical wood and buildings as well as dendroprovenancing. Materials and Methods: A total of 57 wood samples were collected from historical timber from windmills and architectural elements, including doors and warehouse planks, while 68 cores were collected from the three dominant tree species of the island—Cupressus sempervirens, Pinus brutia, and Quercus ithaburensis subsp. macrolepis—in an attempt to develop local reference chronologies that could be useful in dating historical timber Results: Of the historical timber, at least nine different species have been detected, with conifers representing the majority of the collected material. In total, 56% of the dendroarchaeological samples, belonging to four different species, were dated absolutely. According to cross-dating and dendroprovenancing results, Pinus nigra, Cedrus sp., and Quercus sp. represent timber imported from present-day Turkey while the fir samples collected from the windmills originate from Central Europe. The use of local timber is also highly probable although it could not be confirmed by the reference chronologies developed for the three dominant tree species of the island. Conclusions: The results of the study reveal the dendrochronological potential of the island from both dendroarchaeological and dendroecological perspectives. The finding that most of the wood was imported mainly from Turkey highlights the importance of timber trade with the Turkish mainland during the mid-18th and 19th centuries. Chronologies developed from living trees could be used in future studies for dating historical material while further research would increase our understanding of past timber trade and the island’s history. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Castle Pišece, located in SE Slovenia near the border with Croatia, is thought to have been built in the 12th/13th century as one in the line of Salzburg fortresses on the then SE border of the Holy Roman Empire. During thorough restoration that started in 2005, its wooden constructions became accessible for dendrochronological investigations. We collected representative samples from floor or ceiling constructions in most of the rooms in the castle. Dendrochronology helped us to identify felling dates of wood and to propose probable years of reconstructions in 1515, 1578, 1644, 1697, 1752, 1758, 1775 and 1878. The dating showed that the constructions in the presumed Romanesque and Renaissance parts of the building were not as old as expected, whereas those in the supposedly Baroque part of the castle were older than assumed. The selection of wood species used for constructions varied over time. Constructions with end dates 1515-1697 were made of oak (. Quercus petraea and Q. robur), those dated to 1752 of silver fir (. Abies alba), those dated to 1758 of sweet chestnut (. Castanea sativa) and those dated to 1878 of common beech (. Fagus sylvatica). Comparison of forestry archives and vegetation in the area showed that most of the timber could have originated from nearby forests; only silver fir had to be transported from sites that were at least 20. km away from the castle. Cross-dating of tree-ring series of oak elements with two reference chronologies from Slovenia and two from Austria confirmed the great likelihood that the wood used mostly originated from Slovenia. This indicates that dendroprovenancing, not used in the area before, could also be used SE of the Alps. Both the existing archival documents and dendrochronology indicate that woodworks have taken place every few decades in some periods. The dendrochronological dates can be partly linked to reports on earthquakes (especially the devastating one in 1511), rebellions and year marks carved on the stone plaques. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

	abstract = {This paper presents initial data from an ongoing study that employs strontium (Sr) isotopic analysis ( 87Sr/ 86Sr ratios) in an attempt to provenance archaeological cedar wood from the east Mediterranean region. Cedar was used in shipbuilding, among other roles, in ancient Egypt and the Near East, and provenance of recovered wood is only surmised in studies to date. As the first step in this dendroprovenance study, a ca. 600 year dendrochronology was developed for living cedars on Cyprus, extending back to about AD 1412. Additionally, 87Sr/ 86Sr ratios for wood provenance are established for two different cedar groves in the Troodos Mountains in Cyprus. The 87Sr/ 86Sr results reflect a closer correlation of cedar wood with seawater than with Troodos ophiolite bedrock, indicating the greater influence of sea-induced rainfall and sea-spray in this island environment. The results of the Cypriot wood are compared to Cedrus libani from Lebanon and Turkey with promising results. Due to the higher value of 87Sr/ 86Sr results for C. brevifolia in Cyprus, versus intermediate and lower values for Turkey and Lebanon, respectively, successful provenance of archaeological wood may be possible. In the future, this method may be coupled with dendroprovenancing techniques for more accurate localized results. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {The Wabash and Erie Canal system was an important transportation network in the early 1800s prior to the dominance of trains and later automotive transportation. In this work, timbers from Culvert 151 were examined, after they were exhumed during construction of Hwy 641 on the south side of Terre Haute, Indiana. Cross-sections were taken from each of 22 beams and allowed to air dry to determine the stability of the timbers. We examined the wood to determine the genera or species of each sample that was used in this construction project and developed a floating chronology from our white oak group samples. The mix of species present included 11 beams of American beech (Fagus grandifolia), five white oak group (Quercus subgenus Lepidobalanus), and one each of American elm (Ulmus americana), winged elm (Ulmus alata), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and black walnut (Juglans nigra). This suggests that the timbers were cut from the available trees in a certain size class without much regard for wood properties. The oak trees were an average of 186 years in age and the floating chronology dated to AD 1827. We also compared our chronology to 16 other oak chronologies in the region using an Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) algorithm in ArcGIS to determine the most likely provenance of the samples. Our oak chronology correlates the strongest to archaeological samples from southeastern Indiana in Jefferson County along the Ohio River. It is possible that the timbers were cut near Madison Indiana, shipped down the Ohio River and up the Wabash River prior to incorporation in Culvert 151 on the Wabash and Erie Canal. © 2016 by The Tree-Ring Society.},

	abstract = {In southern Spain, the Cazorla Mountains (500-2,100 m a.s.l.) have supplied construction timber from black pine (Pinus nigra Arn.) for buildings and ships since at least the Middle Ages. To establish the age and provenance of wooden cultural heritage originating from this area, well-replicated long-span chronologies are needed. Old-living trees occur at high elevations, whereas many historical timbers originated from lower altitudes; hence, crossdating possibilities were questionable. To assess the potential of this species for the development of a multi-millennia tree-ring data set with living trees and historical timbers for the western Mediterranean, we developed four ring-width chronologies along the circa 1,000 m altitudinal range of black pine in these mountains and examined crossdating patterns and climate-growth responses along with altitude and through time. Teleconnections with other Iberian and Mediterranean tree-ring data were also tested. A well-replicated chronology spanning AD 1331-2009 was obtained at the upper site, while lower elevations delivered shorter chronologies. Similarity among chronologies and responses to climate were dependent on elevation. Tree-ring width was negatively related to temperature in previous late summer and positively to February-March, whereas precipitation had an opposite effect; some negative influence of early summer temperature was also observed. However, growth responses were rather unstable throughout the twentieth century. These chronologies showed good tele- and heteroconnections with conifer chronologies from Iberia, northern Morocco and Turkey, evidencing the existence of a common macroclimatic signal, which also varied along with elevation. The relevance of these results for dendrohistorical studies is discussed. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Dendroclimatology offers the unique opportunity to reconstruct past climate at annual resolution and wood from historical buildings can be used to extend such information back in time up to several millennia. However, the varying and often unclear origin of timbers affects the climate sensitivity of individual tree-ring samples. Here, we compare tree-ring width and density of 143 living larch (Larix decidua Mill.) trees at seven sites along an elevational transect from 1400 to 2200 m asl and 99 historical tree-ring series to parametrize state-of-the-art classification models for the European Alps. To achieve geographical provenance of the historical series, nine different supervised machine learning algorithms are trained and tested in their capability to solve our classification problem. Based on this assessment, we consider a tree-ring density-based and a tree-ring width-based dataset for model building. For each of these datasets, a general not species-related model and a larch-specific model including the cyclic larch budmoth influence are built. From the nine tested machine learning algorithms, Extreme Gradient Boosting showed the best performance. The density-based models outperform the ring-width models with the larch-specific density model reaching the highest skill (f1 score = 0.8). The performance metrics reveal that the larch-specific density model also performs best within individual sites and particularly in sites above 2000 m asl, which show the highest temperature sensitivities. The application of the specific density model for larch allows the historical series to be assigned with high confidence to a particular elevation within the valley. The procedure can be applied to other provenance studies using multiple tree growth characteristics. The novel approach of building machine learning models based on tree-ring density features allows to omit a common period between reference and historical data for finding the provenance of relict wood and will therefore help to improve millennium-length climate reconstructions. © 2023 The Authors.

The dendrochronological dating is considered one of the principal techniques for the study of wood of historical and architectural interest. When the traces left by the history make a correct reading of the context impossible, the results given by dendrochronology are often the only certain data useful as a reference. Wood species identification and tree-ring analysis allow far more than just dating: often it is possible to identify the provenance of the woods, closely studying some technical aspects, detecting major or minor interventions of restoration, substitution, and reuse, and, in some fields of study, verifying the attribution of the artifact to a certain artist or school. The power of dendrochronology is based on the rigorous scientific approach and the complete independence from other stylistic or historical considerations. © 2019 Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

With the pooled series of all instruments, a mean chronology spanning 280 years between 1658 and 1938, named Museum Schmidl Trieste (MST), was constructed.

	abstract = {To what extent long-distance transport in north-western Europe changed after the Roman period is generally unknown. Few historical sources are available and existing archaeological records are unclear and sometimes conflicting. Traditionally, research on the long-distance exchange of goods mostly has focussed on the spatial analyses of luxery goods such as jewellery, weapons and religious artefacts. Relatively little attention has been paid to the spatial modelling of common exchange networks and transport routes. In this study we used a dendroarchaeological approach to model long-distance transport of oak (a common good) to the Roman and early-medieval Netherlands. By combining established and newly-derived provenances of imported timbers with data on Roman and early-medieval route networks, we were able to reconstruct: (a) Roman and early-medieval exchange networks of imported timbers, (b) changing transport routes and (c) spatially shifting frequent-travel zones. The findings were compared with distribution patterns of other commodities for daily use: pottery and stone household goods. Results show that in the early and middle-Roman periods (12 BCE – CE 270) timbers were imported from the German Rhineland, the Ardennes and the Scheldt region. We have no evidence for wood import to the current Netherlands during the late-Roman period and first phase of the Early Middle Ages (CE 270–525). In the following centuries, between CE 525–900, oak again was brought to the current Netherlands, this time exclusively originating from the German Rhineland. This pattern significantly changed during the last phase of the Early Middle Ages (CE 900–1050) when timbers were derived from the Ardennes only. We used these patterns to calculate changes in long-distance transport routes and frequent-travel zones in the research area. Through our analyses existing data on Roman and early-medieval route networks could be expanded and improved. The calculated wood-transport patterns agree well with the distribution of imported pottery and (other) household goods in these periods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

They highlight three felling phases (Medieval period, 17th-18th century, and 19th century). The best documented one corresponds to the 17th-18th centuries and coincides with significant building activity connected to the status of Aix, which is the parliamentary capital of Provence. Around Aix-en-Provence, it is difficult to find timbers with good dimensions. Our results show that timbers were transported from the Alps to Aix's buildings. Potential testimonies of this timber trade have been found, such as raft assemblage marks, and carved signs and letters. A dendroprovenancing case study shows that between 1810 and 1890, some of Aix's timbers could have come from the Northern French Alps or the Verdon-Durance region. Finally, the lack of timbers with good dimension and the difficulties of timber supply contributed to the development of reuse economy and technical innovation. These results are the foundation of a future well-established dendroprovenancing approach in the Southern Alps. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) holds significant importance as a forest tree species throughout the Alps and in certain regions of central Europe. Its extensive use as construction timber has made it a subject of substantial interest in dendroarchaeological studies aimed at understanding the long-term interactions between human societies and forests. Precise dating of felling phases, accurate estimation of the age of harvested wood, and information on the geographical origin of wood play a crucial role when it comes to characterize these interactions. In this study, we compiled a large dataset of L. decidua samples from across the European Alps to provide a robust statistical model that predicts the cambial age of L. decidua trees based on the number of heartwood rings. By extension, this model can be used to estimate the number of sapwood rings so as to approximate the felling date and to more precise date archaeological larch timber. The model requires almost complete heartwood sequences (<5 missing rings) to achieve accurate estimations. Our results also evidence that the ratio between the number of sapwood and heartwood rings varies across the Alps. At the same time, the indicator developed in this work is not suitable for a determination of wood origin, raising doubts about the effectiveness of attempts aimed at dendroprovenancing L. decidua based on sapwood. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Studies on the provenance of wood for shipbuilding contribute widely to the fields of archaeology, anthropology, environmental history, cultural geography, and palaeoclimatology. The development of reference datasets to determine the date and provenance of shipwreck timbers is therefore a paramount undertaking. Here we compile and present recent advances in the development of tree-ring chronologies, stable strontium isotope ratios and chemical biomarkers aimed to determine the date and provenance of Iberian shipwreck timbers. A set of oak and pine tree-ring chronologies have been developed from living trees covering the past 500 and 800 years, respectively, and have served to confirm the provenance of the wood used in an 18th-century Spanish ship of the Royal Navy. Stable strontium isotopic signatures have been obtained from soil and living trees at 26 sites throughout the Iberian Peninsula, providing a climate-independent geochemical network to source the origin of historic timbers. However, retrieving the original isotopic signature from waterlogged samples remains unsuccessful, stressing the need to develop effective protocols to separate the seawater signal from the original strontium isotope ratios in the wood. Analyses of organic compounds in wood of living trees have proven suitable to discriminate species and provenances, but results on shipwreck timbers are inconclusive and should be further explored. Our regional approach has the potential to be expanded to other areas and archaeological timbers from different periods throughout the Anthropocene. We highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques presented when applied to waterlogged wood, propose GIS tools to interpret and visualize combined results, and stress the need to expand these type of reference datasets to allow for multiproxy dendroprovenancing approaches. © 2020 The Authors},

The purpose of the paper is to present the results obtained from the dating and dendroprovenancing of the wooden timbers from this historical jetty. A total of 145 oak and fir samples were collected for dating. The cutting dates of the oak timbers were determined to be from AD 1762-1763, which has also been confirmed by archaeological documents. The best statistical values (Gleichläufigkeit value 76%, TVBP 10.0 and CDI 82) were obtained using the oak chronology for Vezneciler from the Asian side of the Bosporus, which represents construction phases dating to AD 1762-1763. The highest statistical matches for the oak tree-ring series from both Yenikapı and Vezneciler were obtained using reference chronologies from northern Greece and Kosovo. Three site chronologies from the forests of Bolu, Karabük and Kastamonu were used to date the fir samples, and the cutting date was determined to be AD 1906. The best statistical results were obtained from the site chronology for Kastamonu (Gleichläufigkeit value 72%, TVBP 10.3 and CDI 79). Due to the significant correlation with this site chronology, the origin of the fir samples may be from the forests of Kastamonu, which is the nearest fir forest along the Black Sea. Because roads and railways were not common during this period, the fir timbers may have been transported via the Black Sea to Yenikapı located near the Marmara Coast. We can conclude from this evidence that construction near the Byzantine harbor continued to utilize imported timbers into the Ottoman period. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {In Europe the mature stage in the life cycles of cockchafers, 3-4 years for Melolontha melolontha L. and 4 years for Melolontha hippocastani Fabr., often causes foliage damage in deciduous forests. Within the scope of dendrochronology, secondary effects on wood production have been generally observed in treering series of rather old oak trees. Flight years were detected by eye and/or sign-test (Gleichläufigkeit) principally with reference to a 50-year long schematic model representing the cockchafer's reproduction cycles. In the SW German dendroarchaeological record, the detection of cockchafer effects in short oak tree-ring series from different periods has led to a reconsideration of the mode of calculation, which now takes into account a shorter time span which is in better agreement with the development of the cockchafer populations (∼30 years) and paying particular attention to the calendar distribution of the cockchafer flight systems known in the region North of the Alps. In the case of the 3-year cycle of M. melolontha, the distribution of the recorded years shows three superimposed, 1-year shifted middle frequency signals almost corresponding to the development of cockchafer populations and their three known flight systems (A: Basel; B: Berne; C: Uri). Consequently, regional patterns reflecting this development in space and time can be used as support for dating short tree-ring sequences and also for the question of timber supply and dendroprovenancing. Moreover, gradation cycles of cockchafer populations along with the frequency of mass outbreaks can be evaluated from an ecological and climatological perspective, with respect to human clearing activities and short- to middle-term changes of landscape. © 2014 Association for Environmental Archaeology.},

	abstract = {Ring-width series are important for diverse fields of research such as the study of past climate, forest ecology, forest genetics, and the determination of origin (dendro-provenancing) or dating of archaeological objects. Recent research suggests diverging climate-growth relationships in tree-rings due to the cardinal direction of extracting the tree cores (i.e. direction-specific effect). This presents an understudied source of bias that potentially affects many data sets in tree-ring research. In this study, we investigated possible direction-specific growth variability based on an international (10 countries), multi-species (8 species) tree-ring width network encompassing 22 sites. To estimate the effect of direction-specific growth variability on climate-growth relationships, we applied a combination of three methods: An analysis of signal strength differences, a Principal Component Gradient Analysis and a test on the direction-specific differences in correlations between indexed ring-widths series and climate variables. We found no evidence for systematic direction-specific effects on tree radial growth variability in high-pass filtered ring-width series. In addition, direction-specific growth showed only marginal effects on climate-growth correlations. These findings therefore indicate that there is no consistent bias caused by coring direction in data sets used for diverse dendrochronological applications on relatively mesic sites within forests in flat terrain, as were studied here. However, in extremely dry, warm or cold environments, or on steep slopes, and for different life-forms such as shrubs, further research is advisable. © 2019},

	abstract = {This book presents guidance, theory, methodologies, and case studies for analyzing tree rings to accurately date and interpret historic buildings and landscapes. Written by two long-time practitioners in the field of dendrochronology, the research is grounded in the fieldwork data of approximately 200 structures and landscapes. By scientifically analyzing the tree rings of historic timbers, preservationists can obtain valuable information about construction dates, interpret the evolution of landscapes and buildings over time, identify species and provenance, and gain insight into the species matrix of local forests. Authors Darrin L. Rubino and Christopher Baas demonstrate, through full-color illustrated case studies and methodologies, how this information can be used to interpret the history of buildings and landscapes and assist preservation decision-making. Over 1,000 samples obtained from more than 40 buildings, including high style houses, vernacular log houses, and timber frame barns, are reported. This book will be particularly relevant for students, instructors, and professional readers interested in historic preservation, cultural landscapes, museum studies, archaeology, and dendrochronology globally. © 2019 Darrin L.

	abstract = {The larger area of and around the Early Iron Age fortress Heuneburg is focus of decades of archaeological excavations and observations. Additionally, to deciduous oak (Quercus sp.) known as the main timber during this period (Middle to Late Hallstatt c. 750–450 BCE), silver fir (Abies alba) was found recently on the Heuneburg plateau itself and its surroundings. Silver fir is now recognized being a significant source of timber during the Iron Age, in a region where its nowadays natural status is debated and its occurrence is rare. The aim of this study was to determine the possible source of the used timber, which might have been taken from the some 80 km distant Abies-rich Black Forest on the primary bed rock or from stands developed on younger geological formations nearer to the site. For this approach, radiogenic strontium isotope (87Sr/86Sr) analyses were performed on waterlogged wood and on charcoal remains buried in four archaeological contexts from Late Hallstatt period around the princely seat Heuneburg. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios were compared to those of living trees, soils and sediments with respect to the diverse geological background. The geological ground of the archaeological wood was narrowed down to molasse for three structures and to loess, moraine or mass chalk sites for one. The isotopic ratio thus points to growing sites more in the surrounding of the concerned archaeological sites and a more distant Black Forest source can be ruled out. Local evidence of Abies was additionally supported by palynological data from four archaeological sites and by anthracological data from a funeral context near the Heuneburg. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA},

	abstract = {Arctic driftwood represents a unique proxy archive at the interface of marine and terrestrial environments. Combined wood anatomical and dendrochronological analyses have been used to detect the origin of driftwood and may allow past timber floating activities, as well as past sea ice and ocean current dynamics to be reconstructed. However, the success of driftwood provenancing studies depends on the length, number, and quality of circumpolar boreal reference chronologies. Here, we introduce a Eurasian-wide high-latitude network of 286 ring width chronologies from the International Tree Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) and 160 additional sites comprising the three main boreal conifers Pinus, Larix, and Picea. We assess the correlation structure within the network to identify growth patterns in the catchment areas of large Eurasian rivers, the main driftwood deliverers. The occurrence of common growth patterns between and differing patterns within catchments indicates the importance of biogeographic zones for ring width formation and emphasizes the degree of spatial precision when provenancing. Reference chronologies covering millennial timescales are so far restricted to a few larch sites in Central and Eastern Siberia (eastern Taimyr, Yamal Peninsula and north-eastern Yakutia), as well as several pine sites in Scandinavia, where large rivers are missing though. The general good spatial coverage of tree-ring sites across northern Eurasia indicates the need for updating and extending existing chronologies rather than developing new sites. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.},

	abstract = {The chemical analysis of tree rings has attracted the interest of researchers in the past five decades in view of the possibility of exploiting this biological indicator as a widely available, high-resolution environmental archive. Information regarding the surrounding environment can be derived either by directly measuring environmental variables (nutrient availability, presence of pollutants, etc.) or by exploiting proxies (e.g. paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental reconstructions). This review systematically covers the topic and provides a critical view on the reliability of dendrochemical information. First, we introduce the determinable chemical species, such as major elements, trace metals, isotopic ratios, and organic compounds, together with a brief description of their uptake mechanisms and functions in trees. Subsequently, we present the possibilities offered by analytical techniques in the field of tree ring analysis, focusing on direct methods and recent developments. The latter strongly improved the details of the accessible information, enabling the investigation of complex phenomena associated with plant life and encouraging the direct analysis of new analytes, particularly minor organic compounds. With regard to their applications, dendrochemical proxies have been used to trace several processes, such as environmental contamination, paleoclimate reconstruction, global environmental changes, tree physiology, extreme events, ecological trends, and dendroprovenance. Several case studies are discussed for each proposed application, with special emphasis on the reliability of tracing each process. Starting from the reviewed literature data, the second part of the paper is devoted to the critical assessment of the reliability of tree ring proxies. We provide an overview of the current knowledge, discuss the limitations of the inferences that may be drawn from the dendrochemical data, and provide recommendations for the best practices to be used for their validation. Finally, we present the future perspectives related to the advancements in analytical instrumentation and further extension of application fields. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, it appeared that the same three "English" typologies (BALTIC1, BALTIC2 and BALTIC3) were also found in the Southern Netherlands, in proportions varying by period. The diversity of Baltic typologies in England was interpreted by Hillam and Tyers (1995) as reflecting changes in the procurement sources for wood. In addition to this diversification of Baltic typologies in the Southern Netherlands, a Western European provenance was identified for 16% of the wood used in Flemish panels. The research focused on determination of the provenance of these non-Baltic oaks, by comparison between wood from painting panels and site chronologies for all of Belgium, the northern half of France and southwest Germany. Such comparison yielded a network of good correlations between the panel ring series and site chronologies along the Franco-Belgian Meuse and the French Moselle River. Dendrochronological dates obtained for the Flemish panels in the corpus clarify the period during which diversification of Baltic sources intensified. The parallel between the very high proportion of BALTIC1 type woods in Flemish panels before 1565 AD, and its progressive decrease until complete disappearance in the 1620 AD, and quantitative data from the Sound Toll Records, among others, led to interpret the BALTIC1 typology as representing the enormous hinterland exploited by the Gdansk port, the principal place of export for wood until 1565 AD. This port then decreased in importance until its disappearance at the beginning of the 17th century. Oaks closest to BALTIC2 and BALTIC3 types reflect the percentage of exports lost to the Gdansk competitors. The period of increase in the use of oaks of BALTIC2 and BALTIC3 typologies also coincides with the appearance of the use of Meuse/Moselle oaks. Explanations for these changes are in relationship to the politico-economic and religious contexts, in particular the wars of religion starting in the 1560 AD that destabilized Europe, and the separation of Northern and Southern Netherlands in 1585 AD. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

In addition to worship, the building is of extreme historical and architectural interest and preserves valuable medieval artwork inside. The roof structures show modern features combined with ancient decorations and elements, which do not allow to precisely define its chronology. In particular, it is not clear whether the current roof structure dates back to the original construction or is the result of repeated subsequent interventions. The dendrochronological investigation involved 49 structural elements collected from 14 of the 16 trusses. The results obtained from silver fir samples separated the material into two groups: an older one, with a terminus post quem dating back to 1278, and a more recent one, which is the result of interventions of the mid-nineteenth century. The oldest elements are essentially the tie-beam of the trusses, while the replacement interventions have affected the rafters and some prostheses of the tie beams. The dendrochronological analysis showed marked analogies between the oldest roof structure of the church of Prato and that of the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence, suggesting that the timber could comes from the large silver fir forests of Casentino, in Tuscany. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS},

	abstract = {Oak wood was highly appreciated and widely used for construction in past centuries. As population sizes expanded in some regions of Europe, local forests were depleted of high-quality timber. Therefore, regions of soaring economies were importing timber initially from the European market and eventually from other continents. Origin of archaeological or historical timber is usually identified by means of dendroprovenancing, i.e. statistical matching of tree-ring-width (TRW) series of timber of unknown origin with TRW reference datasets. However, this method has pitfalls and limitations and therefore alternative techniques are needed. Here, we used three different DNA analysis methods to investigate the potential of using ancient (a)DNA, extracted from oak timber derived from historical buildings and shipwrecks from a variety of countries. All the material had also been analysed dendrochronologically, so its dating and provenance is demonstrated. We included heartwood samples in this analysis, for which DNA extraction is especially challenging as it contains chemicals that inhibit DNA amplification. We succeeded in amplifying DNA for at least one marker from 56% of samples (including heartwood samples), yielding crucial information that allowed us to identify the potential source area of centuries old timber buildings in Latvia and Denmark and of 750-year-old shipwreck material from Germany. Our results prove the strong potential of DNA analyses for identifying timber origin to the regional scale, but by combining these with the dendrochronological results, we can control the exactitude of the aDNA approach and demonstrate a more nuanced examination of the timber sources for these historic structures. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {An interdisciplinary study was conducted at Qijurittuq (IbGk-3), an archaeological site located on Drayton Island along the eastern shore of Hudson Bay, Nunavik. Local Inuit made important contributions to the research. High school students participated in the field school, and elders shared their traditional knowledge. The elders expressed an interest in the source of the wood used to construct Qijurittuq's semi-subterranean dwellings, and this inspired us to expand our research in that direction. This interdisciplinary study included a reconstruction of the geomorphological and environmental history of Drayton Island, wood provenance and dendrochronology studies, research on house architecture and settlement patterns, and a zooarchaeological analysis. This paper synthesizes the preliminary results of this interdisciplinary investigation within the context of climate change. We discuss the persistence of semi-subterranean dwellings in eastern Hudson Bay long after they had been abandoned elsewhere. At Qijurittuq, their abandonment corresponds with the end of Little Ice Age. However, at the same time, the development of more permanent contact with Euro-Canadians was having a strong impact upon Inuit culture.},

	abstract = {The Gleichläufigkeitskoeffizient (GLK), or the percentage of parallel variation (%PV), is an often used non-parametric similarity measure in dendrochronological research. However, when analysing big data sets using the GLK, this measure has some issues. The main problem is that it includes not only synchronous but also semi-synchronous growth changes. These are years in which the growth in one of the compared series does not change in two subsequent years. This influences the GLK, often only slightly, but the larger the data set the stronger the effect. The similarity between tree-ring series can be more objectively expressed by replacing the GLK with the synchronous (SGC) and semi-synchronous growth changes (SSGC). The calculation is similar, since GLK = SGC + SSGC/2. Large values of the SSGC are indicative of possible anomalies or even errors. The SGC is much better suited than the GLK to describe similarity. The SGC should therefore be used to analyse big data sets, for clustering and/or dendroprovenance studies. It is recommended to combine the SGC with parametric measures. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Dendrochronology is not a new method for attaining high-precision dates for archaeological and historic remains of timber. But the extent to which dendrochronology is utilized to attain detailed precision of the dating of complex wooden structures can suffer from the fact that the method is often applied in commercial archaeology, where the extent of analysis is severely limited by cost constraints. Instead of lamenting the potentially lost levels of detail that might have slipped through over the years, it is hoped that by presenting the potential of high chronological precision, that necessitates extensive sampling of timber and wood remains on archaeological sites, a new future will be promoted, in which new wide-ranging sampling strategies will become a more normal practice in archaeology, in both the research and commercial spheres. In this paper, I present some case studies where extensive tree-ring analysis of well-preserved wood remains have resulted in annual chronological detail, allowing an insight into the processes of building, and into the duration of structures that comprised the built environment of past peoples’ lives. In addition, we should not discuss precision dating for urban archaeological study without also touching on the subject of timber trade and timber provenance. Tree-ring studies are increasingly providing us with high precision provenance identification, not just for shipwrecks, barrels and other ‘portable’ objects. It is also allowing us to map trade in bulk structural timber. These analyses are providing us with insights into links between territories. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Dendrochronological research in NW Spain is aimed at developing reference chronologies of oak (Quercus sp.), which are suitable for absolute age determinations of cultural heritage from the Basque Country. So far, the main research interest has been on rural architecture such as farmhouses and barns. In order to extend the application range of Basque dendrochronology, the current study focuses on tree-ring research of rural furniture. In close consultation with the curators of cultural centre Gordailu (Irun), four granary chests and a wardrobe were selected for this pilot study. The tree-ring patterns of these objects significantly match against the new Basque reference chronologies, yielding absolute calendar years for the studied panels. The last-formed measured ring from the oldest granary chest in this collection dates to AD 1517. The other three chests have last-formed rings dating to AD 1580, 1665 and 1829, and the wardrobe has a last-formed ring dating to AD 1439. Sapwood ring counts from living oaks in this region were used to estimate the number of sapwood rings missing on the outside of the panels. Derived absolute and terminus post quem felling dates of wood were further refined by adding the estimated drying time of the wood based on information derived from traditional carpenters in this area. All dendrochronologically established construction dates constitute a correction or refinement of the original art-historical age determinations. In addition, the previously assigned provenance of one granary chest could be corrected. These results indicate that dendrochronology is an excellent method to refine our knowledge about the age, and in some cases the exact geographical provenance, of rural movable heritage in and from the Basque region. The fact that the previously established provenance of four of the studied objects within the Basque Country could not be refined further implies that most Basque reference chronologies at present are not sufficiently specific for assessing wood provenance on an intra-regional scale. This can be solved in the future by reassembling the data underlying these chronologies into homogeneous timber groups covering smaller, ecologically more similar, geographical growth areas. ©  Copyright © 2022 by the Tree-Ring Society.},

During archaeological surveys in 2011 and 2012 in the Nadymskiy Gorodok settlement, located in the forest-tundra zone in Yamalia, northwestern Siberia, 347 samples of construction timbers were taken and analyzed with dendroarchaeological methods. The main species are larch (Larix sibirica (Ledeb.)), spruce (Picea obovata (Ledeb.)) and pine (Pinus sibirica (Du Tour)). Methodical approaches that allow the determination of the source of the wood and correct dating of the time of the constructions are presented. The tree-ring dating of eleven buildings and parts of the palisade highlighting four periods of construction activity during the second half of the 15th century (i.e. at around 1466 AD and 1475 AD) and the first half of the 16th century (at the beginning of the 16th century and after 1530 AD). The results determine that only two wooden structures were built using wood from local forests. In all other cases, the distribution of the dendrochronological dates and timber provenance indicates the use of driftwood from forests further upstream of the Nadym River. Thus, for a precise determination of construction activity in the Nadymskiy Gorodok settlement, a long exposure time of the driftwood needs to be considered and previous presumptions about the settlement history revised. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The study of materials that comprise artworks significantly contributes to understanding of age and provenance. While dendrochronology is a particularly valuable and well-established technique for panel paintings comprising oak timber, conventional practices of resurfacing end-grains to reveal tree rings is becoming less acceptable because it removes material, modifying the painting. Recently, application of non-destructive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy to a portrait of Henry VIII held by the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW), Sydney, Australia revealed tree-ring boundaries in the resulting high-resolution elastic scatter XRF map. In this study, we examine the dendrochronological potential of that mapping with the aim of contributing to resolving the relationship of the AGNSW portrait to similar paintings elsewhere. Examination of the timber revealed affinities with Quercus petraea (Matt.). We measured tree-ring widths along multiple paths in the XRF scatter map and crossdated the resulting 81-year XRF ring-width (XRF portrait) series against master chronologies of English, western European, and Baltic origin. Rather than an arbitrarily defined threshold, we used a Bonferroni correction to determine a minimum significance level for crossdating. While the XRF portrait series did not crossdate with the continental European chronologies, we identified a single significant (α = 3.4 × 10−6) dating position with the English chronology (1400–1480 CE). Cross-matching with site-level chronologies revealed a cluster of high t-values in central-southern England. The earliest date of felling precedes the documented date of completion for the AGNSW and two similar Tudor portraits of Henry VIII held by the National Portrait Gallery (NPG), London and one at the Society of Antiquaries, London. While the apparent British provenance of timber used in the AGNSW portrait contrasts to Baltic origin of timbers used for the two NPG portraits and the majority of English panel paintings, it is consistent with the provenance of the timber used for the Society of Antiquaries portrait. © The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works 2020.},

Since 2013, this experience has been extended within the scope of the research project ‘After the Black Death: Painting and Polychrome Sculpture in Norway’. The source material for the project is a collection of late-medieval winged altarpieces, shrines, polychrome sculpture, and fragments from Norwegian churches, which are owned by the Museum of Cultural History, University of Oslo. The majority cannot be sampled, and many are too large to fit into the CT scanner. For these reasons, a combined approach was adopted, utilizing CT scanning where possible, but preceded by an ‘exposed-wood’ imaging technique. Both non-invasive techniques have yielded reliable results, and CT scanning has confirmed the reliability of the imaging technique alone. This paper presents the analytical methods, along with results from two of the 13 objects under investigation. Results for reliable dates and provenances provide new foundations for historical interpretations. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Illegal logging is a major cause of worldwide deforestation, and demands for scientific methods to identify the geographic origin of timber are increasing. "Dendroprovenancing" is one such method, in which the origin of unknown wood is estimated by calculating correlations of the ring-width series of the unknown wood with reference trees of known geographic origins. We applied the dendroprovenancing method to carbon isotope network data of pinyon pines (Pinus edulis and Pinus monophylla) from the southwestern United States to test the efficacy of using a carbon isotope time series for provenancing wood. First, we calculated correlations (t values) between test trees temporarily assumed to be of unknown origin and reference trees from 13 surrounding sites. Then, we plotted the t values on a map. When provenancing was successful, the tested trees showed the strongest correlation with reference trees from sites close to the actual origins of the test trees, and the correlations decreased with the distance between the original sites of test and reference trees. This conical distribution of t values enabled provenancing of wood with precision of 114-304 km. Although isotope measurement is more expensive and laborious than ring-width measurement, our tests of provenancing pinyon pines in the southwestern United States showed a higher success rate with carbon isotopes. © 2009 The Japan Wood Research Society.},

	abstract = {This two-volume set highlights the importance of Iberian shipbuilding in the centuries of the so-called first globalization (15th to 18th), in confluence with an unprecedented extension of ocean navigation and seafaring and a greater demand for natural resources (especially timber), mostly oak (Quercus spp.) and Pine (Pinus spp.). The chapters are framed in a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary line of research that integrates history, Geographic Information Sciences, underwater archaeology, dendrochronology and wood provenance techniques. This line of research was developed during the ForSEAdiscovery project, which had a great impact in the academic and scientific world and brought together experts from Europe and America. The volumes deliver a state-of-the-art review of the latest lines of research related to Iberian maritime history and archaeology and their developing interdisciplinary interaction with dendroarchaeology. This synthesis combines an analysis of historical sources, the systematic study of wreck-remains and material culture related to Iberian seafaring from the 15th to the 18th centuries, and the application of earth sciences, including dendrochronology. The set can be used as a manual or work guide for experts and students, and will also be an interesting read for non-experts interested in the subject. Volume 2 focuses on approaches to the study of shipwrecks including a synthesis of dendro-archaeological results, current interdisciplinary case studies and the specialist study of artillery and anchors. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

The exact determination of the age of historical timber is undoubtedly the most important contribution of dendrochronology to building research. The significance of dendrochronological dates is discussed in detail—problems of reuse repair, drying time, and differences between felling and building dates are demonstrated. Several case studies in Eastern Austria showed a difference of two to four years between felling and building. To answer questions of where the timber came from, dendroprovenancing was introduced to Eastern Austria. First results showed that it will be possible to differentiate the origin of timber between Eastern Austria and regions where rafts started towards Vienna, via the river Danube. The results showed that it is important to combine building archaeology and archival analyses with the dendrochronological results. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Dendroprovenancing studies frequently use site chronologies to identify the origin of archaeological and historical timber. However, radial growth (tree-ring width, TRW) of tree species is influenced by both local and regional climate scales. Here we investigate how the use of annually-resolved Blue Intensity (BI) measurements can enhance dendroprovenancing precision of black pine (Pinus nigra Arn.) and Scots pine (P. sylvestris L.) on the Iberian Peninsula. Principal Component Gradient Analyses (PCGA) was used to assess geographical patterns of annual variation in different TRW and BI proxies of pine trees from two mountain ranges in the Central System and Andalusia in Spain. Local climate-growth relationships were quantified to identify underlying causes of identified groups with diverse growth patterns. Two distinct elevational groups were observed when performing PCGA on latewood BI time series with the response to summer drought as the main factor causing the differences. Both P. nigra and P. sylvestris BI time series were found to be more related to summer drought at low-elevation sites showing an increase in sensitivity at lower latitudes. PCGA of TRW time series allowed to discriminate between trees from Andalusia and Central System within the elevation groups. February and October temperatures were found to be the main climatic factors causing the differences in TRW time series among the high- elevation sites, whereas for low-elevation trees it was the average winter temperature influencing TRW. A subsequent leave-one-out analyses confirmed that including latewood BI time series improves the precision of dendroprovenancing of pine wood in the Iberian Peninsula. © 2020 The Author(s)},

Here we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this approach using Sr isotope data for bedrock, trees and rainfall collected at seven sites in the Czech Republic. The study included basalt, durbachite, granite, paragneiss, limestone and phyllitic slate. The range of 87Sr/86Sr ratios of these bedrock types was extremely large (0.704–1.743). The investigated tree species included oak, pine, and spruce. Within-tree variability in 87Sr/86Sr ratios (~0.010) was two orders of magnitude smaller than the variability in Sr ratios across the studied bedrock types. Oak and pine growing on identical bedrock exhibited statistically indistinguishable 87Sr/86Sr ratios. In four types of spruce tissues from a particular site, the 87Sr/86Sr ratios were indistinguishable, while significantly different from spruce tissues at another site. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the wood differed from those of bedrock, converging to the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of rainfall (0.709–0.714). Even at a 450-km distance from the nearest sea, atmospheric Sr partly originated from sea-spray. Incorporation of atmospheric Sr in trees often results in overlapping 87Sr/86Sr ranges and hampers source identification of archaeological wood. © 2021},

Our analysis revealed a strong teleconnection of the compiled chronologies with Scots pine chronologies constructed in Poland, Latvia, Estonia, and Belarus. The established link with Belarus chronologies and the fact that some of the timber in Lithuanian buildings could be of Belarus origin is important in the long-distance timber trade during the last 500 years. Dendroclimatological analysis has shown that constructed tree-ring chronologies are sensitive to air temperatures in February and March. Therefore, the constructed chronologies have a potential for climate reconstructions and dendroprovenancing. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {The pairwise statistical comparison of ring-width series is the basic analysis of dendro-provenancing studies. It is assumed that statistical proximity indicates similar provenance, but this assumption often remains untested. Especially for small areas with high topographic complexity, it is unknown to what extent statistical proximity and geographical provenance are correlated. In this paper, dendro-provenancing is framed as a search for statistical Nearest Neighbors. The ‘k-Nearest Neighbors leave one-out cross-validation’ process (k-NN) is proposed as a method for validating dendro-provenancing approaches. Furthermore, it allows researchers to consistently compare and evaluate different proximity measures with respect to their suitability for dendro-provenancing. The validation process is demonstrated on a data set of 401 ring-width series of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) encompassing 15 sites along elevational gradients in north-eastern Switzerland. Moreover, a new type of plot, the so-called scissor plot, is introduced to visualize the k-NN validation process. Results indicate that dendro-provenancing depends heavily on differences in between sites high-frequency signal. Mean classification success for the relevant stages of the k-NN (CSR¯open)1 ranged from 71.8% to 79.2% for the best performing measures. Classification errors occurred mainly between sites at elevations of 1000–1198 m a.s.l. At all other elevations and between different regions of the study area, only moderate differences in classification performance were detected. Thus, the results indicate that dendro-provenancing may be principally feasible even in a small region as studied here. © 2018 The Author},

	abstract = {Studying the wood of art objects such as sculptures, panel paintings and furniture can be crucial to elucidate their chronology and production centre. Here we present an approach that considers the provenance of the wood and its potential availability in different areas as a means to identify the provenance of wooden art objects. We illustrate this approach with an interdisciplinary study aimed to determine the date and provenance of the Woman with lantern, a carved altar fragment from the Rijksmuseum's collections (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The origin of this object is undocumented, but based on stylistic and iconographic features its provenance was proposed to be the altarpiece of Rennes cathedral (France), carved in Antwerp (Belgium) around 1520 C.E. However, doubts arose when curators tested the potential fit of the sculpture in that altarpiece and could not find a neat match. Dating and provenancing the wood of the sculpture by standard dendrochronological means failed to produce a date, and comparison of the tree-ring pattern from the sculpture with those of the sculptures from Rennes altarpiece delivered no results either, supporting the suspicion that the Woman with lantern belonged elsewhere. In 2019, X-ray computed tomography (CT) provided digital cross-sections throughout the sculpture and a longer tree-ring series was obtained. This time, the outermost ring was dated to the year 1487 C.E. The tree was estimated to have been cut after 1495 C.E., indicating a likely production in the first quarter of the 16th century. The origin of the timber in the eastern Netherlands/northwest Germany, combined with empirical evidence about timber availability in various regions of the Low Countries at that time, suggests that the sculpture was made in a workshop located north of the Rhine in the (current) Netherlands, rather than Antwerp. This research has led to the hypothesis that workshops north and south of the Rhine river branches in the Low Countries were supplied by forests located in different areas. If proven correct, establishing the wood provenance will assist in determining the origin of Netherlandish works of art from the late-Gothic and Northern Renaissance periods. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Dendrochronological research in North-Central Europe and the East Mediterranean has produced networks of long regional oak (Quercus sp.) reference chronologies that have been instrumental in dating, provenancing, and paleoclimate research applications. However, until now these two important tree-ring networks have not been successfully linked. Oak forests and historical/archaeological sites in southeastern Europe provide the key for linking the North-Central European and East Mediterranean tree-ring networks, but previous dendrochronological research in this region has been largely absent. This article presents the initial results of a project, in which we have built oak tree-ring chronologies from forest sites and historical/archaeological sites along a north-south transect between Poland and northwestern Turkey, with the aim of linking the North-Central European and East Mediterranean tree-ring networks and creating a new pan-European oak data set for dendrochronological dating and paleoclimatic reconstruction. Correlation among tree-ring chronologies and the spatial distribution of their teleconnections are evaluated. The southeastern European chronologies provide a solid bridge between both major European dendrochronological networks. The results indicate that a dense network of chronologies is the key for bridging spatial and temporal gaps in tree-ring records. Dendrochronological sampling should be intensively continued in southeastern Europe because resources for building long oak chronologies in the region are rapidly disappearing. © 2014 by the Arizona Board of Regents.},

Very often, an ancient musical instrument has been subject to repairs, substitutions and restorations that have modified its original setting. This study takes into account the “Mango Longo guitar”, a masterpiece of 17th century Neapolitan art. It has been analysed from a historical, organological and xylo-chronological perspective to investigate and describe the cultural context of its creation, the wood species used for its construction and various restoration works to which it has been subjected. The Mango Longo guitar belongs to the typology of the Baroque guitars of the seventeenth century, attributed to the lute-maker of German origin Magnus Lang, from which the name derives. The most recent tree-ring identified on the instrument belly is dated dendrochronologically to 1737, terminus post quem. This means that the actual soundboard may be considered a replacement, due to a restoration in the first half of 18th century. The analysis of dendroprovenance of the actual soundboard shows strong analogies with Italian production of the period and identifies the probable sources for wood as being in the Alps. Our results confirm the intensive and well-organized trade of valuable timber used for musical instruments at that time. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

	abstract = {During the Middle Ages northern Belgium and The Netherlands were gradually deforested. A steadily rising demand for quality timber obliged merchants to look for new timber sources. From the 13th century onwards, large volumes of timber were imported from surrounding regions and, despite the remote supply area, merchants of the Hanseatic League managed to organize a huge timber trade from towns around the Baltic Sea. Trees from forests along the Vistula River seem to have been exported via Gdansk, first to Bruges and later to Antwerp. At their final destination the imported wood assortments were highly appreciated for shipbuilding and construction purposes, but also by woodcarvers and famous painters. Over the last decade dendrochronologists have established a dense network of historical site chronologies for northern and central Poland. These site chronologies are supposed to reflect local growth conditions and may allow the identification of the provenance of the wood of many art historical objects made out of Baltic timber. Tree-ring patterns of panel paintings and sculptures, mainly from the 14th-16th centuries, were measured and compared to this data set of site chronologies. An evaluation of the accuracy of sourcing medieval Baltic timbers using standard correlation techniques was made. The identification of provenance enriches historical information on logging activity and timber trade around the Baltic Sea during the Middle Ages. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Aim: Spatial variations of environmental conditions translate into biogeographical patterns of tree growth. This fact is used to identify the origin of timber by means of dendroprovenancing. Yet, dendroprovenancing attempts are commonly only based on ring-width measurements, and largely neglect additional tree–ring variables. We explore the potential of using wood anatomy as a dendroprovenancing tool, and investigate whether it increases the precision of identifying the origin of oak wood. Since different tree–ring variables hold different information on environmental conditions prevailing at specific times of the growing season—which vary between source regions—we hypothesize that their inclusion allows more precise dendroprovenancing. Location: Europe, Spain. Taxon: Quercus robur L., Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl., Quercus faginea Lam., Quercus pyrenaica Willd. Methods: We sampled four oak species across Northern Spain, i.e. from the Basque country and Cantabria and—in the Basque country—from low to high elevation (topographic/latitudinal gradient). We measured multiple tree–ring variables to (a) extract complementary variables; (b) present statistical relations among them; (c) analyse region-specific variation in their patterns based on time–series of individual trees; and (d) determine underlying climate–growth relationships. Leave-one-out analysis was used to test whether a combination of selected variables allowed dendroprovenancing of a randomly selected tree within the area. Results: A combination of latewood width (LW) and earlywood vessel size was used to pinpoint the origin of oak wood with higher precision than ring width or LW only. Variation in LW pinpointed the wood to east and west areas, whereas variation in vessels assigned wood to locations along a latitudinal/topographic gradient. The climatic triggers behind these gradients are respectively an east–west gradient in June–July temperature and a north–south gradient in winter/spring temperatures. The leave-one-out analyses supported the robustness of these results. Main conclusions: Integration of multiple wood–xylem anatomical variables analysed with multivariate techniques leads to higher precision in the dendroprovenancing of ring-porous oak species. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {The 19th century was an era of increasing mechanization and globalization, which transformed maritime networks and shipbuilding in and beyond the Mediterranean. Shipwrecks offer valuable physical evidence of such maritime connectivity and evolving shipbuilding techniques but must be dated within a high-resolution timeframe to be synchronized with, and thereby enhance, historical records. We focus here on high-resolution dating of the Akko Tower Shipwreck, the remains of an Ottoman merchant brig found inside the harbor of Akko, Israel. We use dendrochronology, 14C wiggle-matching, and Bayesian chronological modeling to determine that the ship was likely constructed in the mid-1850s, and therefore called at Akko's harbor after the town's 1840 bombardment, a period of decline traditionally under-studied in Ottoman historical narratives. Using dendroprovenancing methods, we find that the ship's hull used timbers from the Anatolian Black Sea region, although it was built in the French construction tradition, and used British metal rigging and fasteners, which reflect shifting Anglo-French influence and socioeconomic interconnections with the Ottoman Empire during the 19th century. The Akko Tower Shipwreck is the first shipwreck from Israel to be dendrochronologically dated and provenanced. Our results show how dendrochronology and Bayesian chronological modeling can be used successfully not only for high-precision dating, but also for untangling the shipbuilding processes and the socioeconomic networks that made ship construction possible. We also re-evaluate East Mediterranean oak sapwood datasets and develop an approximate new sapwood model that provides more robust estimates of felling dates for tree-ring analysis of this region's oak wooden cultural heritage. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Tree-ring (TR) chronologies are important instruments for the dating and provenance analyses of historical wood, as well as for climate reconstructions. However, radial growth patterns differ between tree species and growing environments. Therefore chronologies are more or less specific for a certain tree species, region and elevation. Chronologies that are restricted to more confined regions could extend the possibilities for dating, dendroprovenancing and regional climate reconstructions.In Southern Germany, the transport of wood by raft - for the supply of towns and cities with timber - has been documented since early mediaeval times. Consequently, not only local timber from the lowlands was used for construction purposes, but also alpine wood originating from sites up to the timberline. Since pronounced altitudinal gradients cause distinct climate differences, elevation-specific chronologies have the potential to improve dating precision in this region.In this contribution, a model is presented and applied in order to separate elevation-specific provenances of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) and Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) in Southern Germany. The model is derived from more than 2100 living TR series originating from sites between 200 and 1710m above see level. Absolute (mean, maximum) ring-width values and the variation of ring-widths (mean sensitivity) show distinct correlations with their altitudinal provenance, reflecting improvements in growth conditions as well as the increase of their yearly variation from high over intermediate to low elevation sites. Mean ring widths and mean sensitivity values were used as independent parameters in an exponential regression model which exhibits a coefficient of determination (r 2) of 77% for spruce and 74% for fir. The prediction accuracy of the elevation amounts ±300m for spruce and ±200m for fir within the 95% confidence interval.The model was used to estimate the elevation origin of around 5000 historical spruce and 800 historical fir series from buildings located in Southern Germany. The historical TR series covering the AD 990-1800 period were allocated by the model to elevations between 120 and 2090. m. In a second step the individual TR series were combined to elevation-specific chronologies representing low, intermediate, and high altitudinal belts. The chronologies show distinct differences among the altitudinal belts in terms of signatures and pointer years, especially for spruce. Elevation-specific chronologies are assumed to amplify the dating possibilities of ancient timber, to provide valuable evidences for the origin of historical wood, and to offer more specific proxy data for regional climate reconstructions. © 2012 Istituto Italiano di Dendrocronologia.},

	abstract = {After 1840, New Zealand kauri (Agathis australis) became the focus of a large-scale timber industry in the upper North Island, which converted trees into timber that was then used in construction. Cities such as Auckland and Wellington relied on importing kauri to meet local demand for construction and other uses. Kauri timbers from buildings and in-ground features, mostly in Auckland city, have been collected for tree-dating and master chronology development. Although the use of timber at archaeological sites is understood, the geographic origin of the timber from within the natural range of kauri (north of 38 °S) is largely unknown. This limits interpretation of archaeological wood and constrains use of the tree-ring data in dendroclimatology. In this paper, we consider the potential to provenance kauri timbers used in 19th and early 20th century New Zealand buildings, using a combination of documentary sources, t-value mapping, and refined statistical matching using spatial patterns of correlations. Analysis of documentary sources for a test period of 1861–1865 CE indicates that there is sufficient information about the kauri timber industry to provide a geographic context for provenancing kauri in the upper North Island. The use of t-values for provenancing may be confounded by the relatively small size of the kauri growth region and a lack of sufficient spatial differentiation in growth patterns between the sub-regions. However, a new approach of using indexed residual chronologies and field correlations has promise for geo-locating timber in a relatively small region. The research highlights the value of establishing kauri provenance to New Zealand dendroclimatology, dendroarchaeology and environmental history. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH},

The ship caught fire while anchored north of the Stora Ekö Island and sank to the seafloor, where it lies to this day. The wreck was rediscovered in the 1970s and is remarkably well preserved. Since 2001, scientific investigations have been performed on the wreck by various organizations. In total, 13 dendrochronological samples from different parts of the ship construction have been collected and analyzed with standard dendrochronological methods with respect to age and provenance. The results show that all dated samples could have been felled during the winter season of 1482/83, although only one sample contains sapwood and waney edge. The highest correlations are obtained from reference chronologies that originate from the River Meuse drainage area, with correlations peaking around the city of Namur in Belgium. Most likely, the ship was constructed in a shipyard close to the mouth of the River Meuse in the southern Netherlands. It seems King Hans realized the potential of the new ship type represented by Gribshunden, but his shipwrights did not have the knowledge to build such a ship in Denmark. Instead, he purchased the ship from abroad. This study highlights late medieval economic and political connections throughout northern Europe. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {We present a stepwise multidisciplinary approach combining woodworking expertise, dendrochronology, DNA genotyping and radiocarbon dating to determine when, where and how historical wooden objects were made. The effective implementation of this approach is demonstrated with a set of wooden stocks from the Rijksmuseum collections in Amsterdam (the Netherlands). In 2019, preceding an exhibition about slavery, stocks made of oak (Quercus sp.) were donated to the Rijksmuseum. The history of the object was unknown, and a stepwise approach was devised to determine the date and potential place of its manufacture, and whether they were made in the context of Dutch colonial slavery. Pencil marks and tool traces found on the surface of the wood are characteristic of traditional woodworking techniques and indicated that the stocks were processed after 1800 C.E., from fresh wood, shortly after the felling of the tree, and in one go. The tree-ring analysis revealed that the beams originate from the same tree, and that the tree grew in a dense forest. However, it failed to return an exact date for the wood and, consequently, also to determine its provenance. Therefore, we decided to employ DNA-genotyping and radiocarbon dating. The retrieval of DNA was successful, and the results placed the provenance of the wood in an area covering a broad latitudinal transect in central Europe. Radiocarbon wiggle matching, modelled with sapwood statistics for central Europe, revealed that the tree was likely cut between 1791 and 1824 C.E. These results combined suggest that the stocks were produced in the first quarter of the 19th century, using local wood, at a small rural town somewhere in Italy, the Pyrenees, eastern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany or even further north (Denmark, Sweden). While their association with slavery in colonised territories seems unlikely, their production in the context of the Dutch colonial system cannot be ruled out. Therefore, they are valuable historical objects worth being curated and exhibited at a national museum. The stepwise approach here presented can be applied to other large objects at museum collections. We encourage curators, conservators and restorers to consider its implementation to maximise knowledge acquisition and appreciation of wooden cultural heritage. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {On July 2010, archaeologists monitoring excavation at the World Trade Center site (WTC) in Lower Manhattan found the remains of a portion of a ship's hull. Because the date of construction and origin of the timbers were unknown, samples from different parts of the ship were taken for dendrochronological dating and provenancing. After developing a 280-year long floating chronology from 19 samples of the white oak group (Quercus section Leucobalanus), we used 21 oak chronologies from the eastern United States to evaluate absolute dating and provenance. Our results showed the highest agreement between the WTC ship chronology and two chronologies from Philadelphia (r = 0.36; t = 6.4; p < 0.001; n = 280) and eastern Pennsylvania (r = 0.35; t = 6.3; p < 0.001; n = 280). The last ring dates of the seven best-preserved samples suggest trees for the ship were felled in 1773 CE or soon after. Our analyses suggest that all the oak timbers used to build the ship most likely originated from the same location within the Philadelphia region, which supports the hypothesis independently drawn from idiosyncratic aspects of the vessel's construction, that the ship was the product of a small shipyard. Few late-18th Century ships have been found and there is little historical documentation of how vessels of this period were constructed. Therefore, the ship's construction date of 1773 is important in confirming that the hull encountered at the World Trade Center represents a rare and valuable piece of American shipbuilding history. © 2014 by The Tree-Ring Society.},

Cross-dating against 7 nearest oak reference chronologies unambiguously dated the youngest ring found in the timber to 1901 AD. The earliest possible felling date of the wood was estimated to 1914 AD taking into account the missing sapwood. The strength of synchrony between the belfry's chronology and the nearby reference ones indicates local timber source. The fact that these samples improved the replication over the poorly covered 19th century period of the Central Hungarian Oak Master Chronology, coinciding with the overlapping period of living and historical material lends special significance to them.},

	abstract = {The paper describes the results of a dendrochronological investigation on historical oak (Quercus robur L.) timbers from the Vilnius Lower Castle excavations. In Lithuania, oak was used only in specific cases during the Middle Ages. Therefore, historical material for tree ring chronology building is lacking. However, the construction of a local oak chronology is of great importance as it can help to determine the provenance of many imported timbers that are part of wooden cultural heritage in Western Europe. Oak samples make 9.2% of the analysed timbers excavated in the Vilnius Lower Castle territory - the largest present-day collection of historical timbers in Lithuania. The main material for Vilnius oak chronology was obtained from the 'bridge foundation (BF)' construction found close to the Royal Palace gate at a depth of 4-5 m. Ring-width series of the oak beams of the 'BF', together with other excavated oak logs were cross-dated and a mean chronology of 217-year length was constructed. The chronology was dated to AD 1202-1418 against the Baltic reference chronologies BALTIC1 (t = 7.57), BALTIC2 (t = 4.52) and WINCHCOL (t = 5.74) (authors J. Hilliam, I. Tyers, D. Mills). The average date of the hardwood - sapwood boundary on the 'bridge' samples that have partially preserved sapwood is between 1406 and 1407. As the average number of oak sapwood rings is considered to be 16, the most probable felling date of trees used for the 'BF' is situated around 1423. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Dendroprovenancing provides critical information regarding the origin of wood, allowing further insights into economic exploitation strategies and source regions of timber products. Traditionally, dendroprovenancing relies on pattern-matching of tree rings, but its spatial resolution is limited by the geographical coverage of species-specific chronologies available for crossdating and, in the case of short-distance trades, by scarce environmental variability. Here, we present an approach to provenance timber with high spatial resolution from forested areas that have been exploited intensively throughout history, with the aim to understand the sustainability of the various woodland management practices used to supply timber products. To this end, we combined tree-ring width (TRW), wood anatomical and geochemical analyses in addition to multivariate statistical validation procedures to trace the origin of living oak trees (Quercus robur) sampled in four stands located within a 30-km radius around the city of Limoges (Haute-Vienne, France). We demonstrate that TRW and wood anatomical variables (and in particular cell density) robustly discriminate the eastern from the western site, while failing to trace the origin of trees from the northern and southern sites. Here, strontium isotopic ratios (87Sr/86Sr) and Ca concentrations identify clusters of trees which could not be identified with TRW or wood anatomy. Ultimately, our study demonstrates that the coupling of wood anatomy with geochemical signatures allows to correctly pinpoint the origin of trees. Given the small geographic scale of our study and the limited differences in elevation and climate between study sites, our results are particularly promising for future dendroprovenancing studies. We thus conclude that the combination of multiple approaches will not only increase the accuracy of dendroprovenancing studies at local scales, but could also be implemented at much larger scales to identify trends in historic timber supply throughout Europe. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Over the last decades, Roman wood in various shapes and sizes has been excavated in the region of the continental north-western provinces of the Roman empire. However, it is often unclear whether wood has been transported. Most dendrochronological provenance studies rely on simple comparisons between tree-ring series based on a single similarity measure. In addition, most fail to consider the complex system of relations that is the result of the variables that influence tree-ring patterns. Network analysis is a solution to this problem, because it allows to both visualize and analyze the complex (provenance) relations of tree-ring series as a whole. A network makes it impossible to ignore existing (statistical) relations between tree-ring series. Although networks can be build using any (combination of) similarity measure(s), in this study a combination of the Synchronous Growth Changes (SGC), its related probability of exceedance (p), correlation (r) and overlap define the edges. This paper focusses on networks with site chronologies as nodes, although networks can also be constructed using individual tree-ring series or a combination with site chronologies. A combination of these can also help to refine the (archaeological) interpretation. The location of any tree-ring series in a network reflects its provenance. Material that is placed closer together in the network has similar growth patterns and is generally from the same region. Therefore, network communities reflect wood that has a similar provenance. If tree-ring material was found on different spatial locations, but in close proximity in the network, this indicates that wood has been moved. To determine which wood has been transported, a combination of archaeological and spatial arguments is used. The method is sound, simple and gives insight in the complexity of all tree-ring relations in a simple diagram. The resulting patterns show that most wood was obtained in the region where it was used, but that transport of wood in the Roman period did take place. Three scales are defined to describe the Roman wood economy: local, provincial and imperial. While transport of wood over long distances is attested for both military and civilian sites (provincial and imperial scale), it seems that wood that was transported beyond the provincial borders was only used in civilian sites (imperial scale). The combination of network science, dendrochronology and archaeology is a powerful method to understand patterns in the Roman timber economy. © 2021 The authors. All right reserved.},

The ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) log was discovered in 1924, and since then, it has been included in birth and life narratives of Pueblo Bonito, although these ideas have not been rigorously tested. We evaluate three potential growth origins of the tree (JPB-99): Pueblo Bonito, Chaco Canyon, or a distant mountain range. Based on converging lines of evidence-documentary records, strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr), and tree-ring provenance testing-we present a new origin for the Plaza Tree. It did not grow in Pueblo Bonito or even nearby in Chaco Canyon. Rather, JPB-99 originated from the Chuska Mountains, over 50 km west of Chaco Canyon. The tree was likely carried to Pueblo Bonito sometime between AD 1100 and 1130, although why it was left in the west courtyard, what it meant, and how it might have been used remain mysteries. The origin of the Plaza Tree of Pueblo Bonito underscores deep cultural and material ties between the Chaco Canyon great houses and the Chuska landscape. © 2020 by the Society for American Archaeology.},

We present the main characteristics of oak ring series and discuss the latest methodological advances in defining the calendar year in which the tree-rings were formed and in interpreting such dating in terms of the age of a wooden object. Dendrochronology has established itself as a standard dating tool and has been applied in a wide variety of (pre-)historical studies. Archaeological wood, historical buildings, works of art (such as panel paintings and sculptures) have been successfully investigated. Recent advances in dendro-provenancing have helped to obtain more information on the timber trade in the past.

The Terminal Warehouse in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City was one of many large buildings erected during this period of city expansion, and is an important symbol of New York City commerce during the late 1800s. To determine the history and provenance of timbers used in the construction of the Terminal Warehouse, we used tree-ring analysis on longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) joists that were original to the building. The ring-width patterns on the joists crossdated well internally, suggesting a common origin of the sampled lumber. Further, our Terminal Warehouse tree-ring chronology (1512–1891 C.E.) correlated strongly with existing tree-ring chronologies from western/central Georgia and eastern Alabama, indicating that the timbers were extracted from this region of the southeastern United States. The provenancing and dating of the Terminal Warehouse timbers underscores the important role that southern pines played in the expansion and development of New York City during the Gilded Age. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Arctic driftwood may represent a cross-disciplinary proxy archive at the interface of marine and terrestrial environments, which will likely gain in importance under future global climate change. Circumpolar network analyses that systematically consider species-specific boreal origin areas, transport routes and deposition characteristics of Arctic driftwood, are, however, missing. Here, we present tree-ring width (TRW) measurements of 2412 pine, larch and spruce driftwood samples from Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, the Faroe Islands, and the Lena Delta in northeastern Siberia. Representing the largest Arctic driftwood TRW compilation, these data are compared against 495 TRW reference chronologies from the boreal forests of Eurasia and North America. The southern Yenisei region is the main source for recent pine driftwood at all Arctic sampling sites, whereas spruce mainly originates in western Russia and central Siberia, as well as in northern North America. Larch driftwood is, for the first time, dendro-provenanced to central and eastern Siberia. A new larch driftwood chronology extends the middle Lena River reference chronology back to 1203 CE. Annually resolved radiocarbon measurements further date six larch driftwood chronologies between 1294 and 2013 CE. Although being highly replicated, our study emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary research efforts including radiocarbon dating, isotopic tracing and aDNA processing for improving Arctic driftwood provenancing in space and time. If successful, Arctic driftwood studies will contribute to the reconstruction of past boreal summer temperature variations and ocean current dynamics, as well as changes in sea ice extent and relative sea level over the last centuries to millennia. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Regional differences in tree growth can be used to approximate the geographical provenance of ring-width series (‘dendro-provenancing’). This method relies on cross-dated ring-width series (reference chronologies) that are thought to represent the radial growth signal of trees in a given region. Reference chronologies are often established from ring-width series of living tree populations. Frequently, they are too short to allow for investigating the provenance of historical wood. Thus, references are extended by ring-width series from buildings and art-historical objects that exhibit best matching growth patterns with the living tree references. Yet, series from other provenances may erroneously be included. Thereby the local or regional growth signal of the references is progressively contaminated, but this has received little attention to date. I investigate this contamination risk using a simulation approach that allows for generating pseudo site chronologies that preserve the relevant statistical properties of the real site chronologies. While the exact provenance of historical wood is unknown, for simulated ring-width series the provenance is unambiguous. Hence, pseudo reference chronologies may be established while monitoring the signal mixture. Specifically, 15 site chronologies of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) from northeastern Switzerland were used to generate 15 pseudo site growth signals that span 1000 years. The simulation demonstrates that quasi uncontaminated references can be established in ideal circumstances for the study area. However, the thresholds for the similarity in between-series correlation must be very high. Even then, contaminated pseudo references occurred in rare cases during the simulation. Yet, elevation-specific pseudo references were established with lower thresholds. Simulation currently offers the only approach for assessing the contamination risk of reference chronologies, and it allows for elucidating the conditions under which acceptable levels of contamination can be guaranteed. Therefore, the present approach paves the way towards a practical simulation tool for dendroprovenancing. Copyright: © 2020 Urs Gut.

This review summarizes this recent progress in regions with a longstanding tradition of using tree-ring methods, such as Europe and the USA, as well as others such as Asia where developments have been particularly rapid in recent years. The oldest wood generally originates from archaeological sites and the largest amount of wood for research comes from historical structures such as monumental and vernacular architecture. In addition to construction wood, wooden doors, ceilings, furniture, objects of art (such as panel paintings and sculptures), Medieval books, musical instruments and boats can also be utilized. Dating is the first and crucial step of the research and is often difficult even in regions where dendrochronology has a long history of use. In addition to absolute dates, dendrochronology has provided extra information that has enhanced historical knowledge from other sources. Behavioral and environmental inferencing and dendroprovenancing are becoming major areas of research in regions with well-developed networks of reference chronologies and active cooperation among laboratories. The online Bibliography of Dendrochronology and information from conferences have been indispensable in this compilation, because much work related to dendrochronology in cultural heritage is still published in "gray" literature, making it difficult to access.

	abstract = {Compared to the alpine regions of Austria, the eastern part of the country is overall warmer and drier with some tree species growing at the dry limit within their ecological range. This suggests that tree rings may be a valuable proxy for hydroclimatic variability. In this study, we develop ring-width, earlywood-width and latewood-width chronologies obtained from drought sensitive living trees and historical timber from one of the driest and warmest regions of Austria, the Weinviertel. For this, samples of four different tree species − fir (Abies alba Mill.), spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), oak (Quercus petraea Liebl., Q. robur L., Q. cerris L.), and pine (Pinus sylvestris L., P. nigra Arnold) were collected from 88 sites (23 forest stands and 65 historical constructions). 1589 samples (oak: 592 samples, pine: 577, spruce: 212, fir: 208) were dated. Dendro-provenancing was required to ensure that only regional material has entered the chronologies. According to the analyses, historical pine and oak wood were nearly 100% regional, while spruce and fir wood were imported to a great extent with only 44% spruce and 35% fir confirmed to be regional. Because site conditions of historical wood samples are unknown but can have a significant influence on tree growth, changes to site replication over time were important in the assessment of chronology reliability. We also controlled for potential artificial increases in sample depth when more than one construction element is made from a single trunk. We assessed the pine (1584-2011 AD) and oak (1244-2011 AD) chronologies’ potential for reconstructing past hydroclimatic variability by means of response functions in a 17-months window from previous June to current October with climate data from three weather stations (Vienna, Retz, Brno) from 1897 to 2010 AD. The highest seasonal response coefficients are for oak and pine ring width (∼0.43) with respect to aggregated March to July precipitation totals and Thornthwaite climatic water balance. These chronologies reveal a high potential for estimating past changes in regional-scale moisture availability during the earlier growing season. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Provenance and age determinations of driftwood provide insights into Holocene Arctic Ocean surface currents and sea ice dynamics, with detailed reconstructions requiring a provenance methodology with fine temporal and spatial resolution. Determination of wood geographical provenance by genus data is limited by its spatially coarse resolution, while provenance by dendrochronological crossdating is reliant on available boreal forest reference chronologies which are abundant for recent centuries but more sparse for older periods of the Holocene. We present the development of novel techniques to refine the provenance of driftwood through radiogenic isotopic analysis (87Sr/86Sr). The use of geochemical techniques addresses limitations of current methods and opens the possibility of defining the role of atmospheric and oceanic circulation in sea ice and climatic changes throughout the Holocene at a finer spatial resolution than currently possible. This study investigates and develops geochemical 87Sr/86Sr fingerprinting of Arctic driftwood. To this end, it analyses driftwood samples from northern Svalbard and compares this technique with provenance regions obtained through dendrochronology, and with modelled and measured global 87Sr/86Sr reference databases. We conclude that the utilisation of 87Sr/86Sr ratios to establish provenance for Arctic driftwood has some potential, but identify important limitations in the method, concerning both the signal in samples and reference values required for provenance. Increased sample populations and source samples for calibration, as well as methodological improvements that address the likely overprinting linked to driftwood transport, are recommended to build upon this work. We conclude that at present dendro-provenancing continues to be the most powerful method to study sea ice dynamics from Arctic driftwood and suggest that given the high spatial granularity of 87Sr/86Sr across the boreal forest, this technique might only be usable in combination with previously developed provenance tools and reconstructions. This study provides a first step in the use of radiogenic isotopic analysis in a multi-proxy reconstruction of Holocene driftwood incursion onto high Arctic shorelines. © 2021},

	abstract = {Dendrochronology is an essential tool to determine the date and provenance of wood from historical art objects. As standard methods to access the tree rings are invasive, X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been proposed for non-invasive dendrochronological investigation. While traditional CT can provide clear images of the inner structure of wooden objects, it requires their full rotation, imposing strong limitations on the size of the object. These limitations have previously encouraged investigations into alternative acquisition trajectories, including trajectories with only linear movement. In this paper, we use such a line-trajectory (LT) X-ray tomography technique to retrieve tree-ring patterns from large wooden objects. We demonstrate that by moving a wooden artifact sideways between the static X-ray source and the detector during acquisition, sharp reconstruction images of the tree rings can be produced. We validate this technique using computer simulations and two wooden test planks, and demonstrate it on a large iconic chest from the Rijksmuseum collection (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The LT scanning method can be easily implemented in standard X-ray imaging units available at museum research facilities. Therefore, this scanning technique represents a major step towards the standard implementation of non-invasive dendrochronology on large wooden cultural heritage objects. © 2021, The Author(s).},

The commonest methodology is to compare individual site chronologies with a network of other chronologies, and to recognise trends in the geographical distribution of strong matches, suggesting the likely source area of the material. Other studies may look at the matching of individual timbers to draw similar conclusions. It is shown that ecological and genetic factors may strongly influence individual matching results and that ring-widths may therefore be considered a somewhat crude means of provenancing. Additional chemical and genetic markers are discussed, although these are unlikely to become routinely used in the near future. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This two-volume set highlights the importance of Iberian shipbuilding in the centuries of the so-called first globalization (15th to 18th), in confluence with an unprecedented extension of ocean navigation and seafaring and a greater demand for natural resources (especially timber), mostly oak (Quercus spp.) and Pine (Pinus spp.). The chapters are framed in a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary line of research that integrates history, Geographic Information Sciences, underwater archaeology, dendrochronology and wood provenance techniques. This line of research was developed during the ForSEAdiscovery project, which had a great impact in the academic and scientific world and brought together experts from Europe and America. The volumes deliver a state-of-the-art review of the latest lines of research related to Iberian maritime history and archaeology and their developing interdisciplinary interaction with dendroarchaeology. This synthesis combines an analysis of historical sources, the systematic study of wreck-remains and material culture related to Iberian seafaring from the 15th to the 18th centuries, and the application of earth sciences, including dendrochronology. The set can be used as a manual or work guide for experts and students, and will also be an interesting read for non-experts interested in the subject. Volume 1 focuses on the history and archaeology of seafaring and shipbuilding in the Iberian early modern world, complemented by case studies on timber trade and supply for shipbuilding, analysis of shipbuilding treatises, and the application of Geographic Information Systems and Databases (GIS) to the study of shipwrecks. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022, Corrected Publication 2022.},

Within the collection, 30 bowed and plucked instruments representative of the Neapolitan violin-making tradition were analysed dendrochronologically to date them, estimate the provenance of the wood and investigate the instruments’ construction characteristics. The values of the statistical cross-dating tests were generally high and allowed 26 instruments to be dated. In all but one case, the dates were consistent with those of the catalogue. From the perspective of wood selection, we noted an unusual use of very old spruce wood, well beyond simple seasoning. The construction technique of the soundboard and other characteristics show good similarities with instruments analysed in other Italian collections. Thus, even in Neapolitan instruments, the growth rings are smaller in small instruments and larger in cellos or double basses. In conclusion, the Neapolitan violin-making school has shown great care in the choice of wood, most coming from regions as far away as Germany or Switzerland, thus confirming the existence of an active large-scale trade in wood for the production of musical instruments. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {A graphical method is used to demonstrate the results of new analytical steps introduced as an aid to provenancing oak within the British Isles. The current method for determining the likely area of origin of a tree-ring series is to map the distribution of t-values obtained when the subject chronology is compared with each of the available reference chronologies. Although useful, this falls into the trap that the t-value itself is subject to variation in length of the series being compared. The first step to overcome this is to instead use the R-value, a common way of characterising inter-site tree-ring relationships. It can be seen however that with dated sites, the geographical spread of well-matching sites is often quite large (the very reason why one can have confidence in the dating). This new method introduces two new steps. The first is to subtract the regional growth signal before comparing the sites. It is then possible to focus on the often more minor local scale variations in growth, the weak relationships previously overwhelmed by the regional signal sometimes becoming apparent using the paired inter-site correlations (residuals). The second step is then introduced, exploiting the information available in these maps. Objectively quantifying the agreement between the spatial correlation fields for a single site is achieved by scoring and mapping the agreement between the inter-site correlation maps for each other site, here termed the ‘field correlation’. It is shown that this sometimes gives an improved indication of the likely area of growth, and can be used in conjunction with any other information available to suggest likely geographical origins with more confidence. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Revealing more detail on the biography of art objects, such as their attribution, dating or the artist's methods and techniques, requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes dendrochronology as a means of providing the chronological order. The 550th anniversary of the birth of Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543) offered an opportunity to conduct an in-depth study of the Toruń portrait of the Great Astronomer, also from a technological and art-historical point of view, and to compare the present findings with the results of the first attempt at dendrochronological dating made in 1987. The analysis of the painting from 2023 showed the following results of dendrochronological dating with the following end dates and time spans of tree ring series: board no. 2 - end date AD 1558, time span AD 1287–1558; and board no. 3 - end date AD 1500, time span AD 1439–1500 and unambiguously demonstrated that this most widely known image of Copernicus was created after his death. While the author of the painting is unknown, the stylistic features may suggest influences of Netherlandish or Flemish painters. The painting panel was made from Baltic oak of Lithuanian or Belarusian origin, and the well-corresponding tree-ring series of numerous Flemish paintings suggest Flanders as the origin of the Portrait of Nicolaus Copernicus. A comparison of the results of the two dendrochronological studies – conducted in 1987 and 2023 using vastly different technological capabilities – provides clear evidence that the tree-ring series developed by the pioneers of art-historical dendrochronology, together with their vast databases, can be used with great confidence. © 2023 Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)},

In this study, 63 samples have been collected and processed using standard dendrochronological methods. Three Baroque churches, coming from the Mukachevo district, were absolutely dated thanks to the preserved waney edge or sapwood tree rings to periods 1734–1744, 1753–1755, and 1783–1795. Two other churches, representing Gothic architecture, were transported from a more eastern part of Transcarpathian Ukraine. One of them was dated to the period after 1655 and the other could not be reliably dated using available reference chronologies. The created mean tree-ring width series representing individual churches showed strong correlations with the reference chronologies for Slovakia and northern Romania whereas correlations with the only Ukrainian chronology (Lviv region) were negligible. This could suggest low Transcarpathian tree-ring coherency and may indicate the need to create a dense network of regional tree-ring width chronologies in the regions surrounding the Carpathian Mountains. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

Analyses of the botanical macroremains of vascular plants trapped in these mosses confirm the different environments these mosses have been collected in, as is suggested by the ecological characteristics of the different identified taxa.

The timber is notably straight-grown. The fine condition of the timber allowed conclusions to be drawn about the tools used to hew it. The joists seem to have originated in a stave structure. The wider evidence for this form of building in England is reviewed and evidence for comparable stave buildings, including the church at Greensted, is considered. It is argued that stave construction was rarely used because of the careful preparation required and the quantity of timber needed. © The Vernacular Architecture Group 2021.},

	abstract = {The results of the dendroarchaeological research carried out on the 16th century altarpiece from the Evangelistas chapel at Seville Cathedral (Spain) are presented. The altarpiece consists of nine panels and was commissioned from the Flemish artist Hernando de Esturmio in AD 1553, who signed the completed work in AD 1555. The research aimed at i) registering information about the processing of the wood and panel making, ii) verifying the AD 1555 construction date, and iii) finding out the provenance of the wood.Five panels were selected for this research. The observed technological features allowed the reconstruction of the production process from borne (oak wainscots) to the final product and, based on that, two types of panels were described. Dendrochronological results showed that the wood employed in both types of panels represents a rather homogeneous group, implying that the raw material was probably transported to Seville in the same batch, and was prepared and assembled using slightly different methods to meet the requirements stipulated by the contract. Sapwood was identified in 12 of the 33 researched planks. The most recent tree-ring dates in AD 1549. Using a Bayesian approach, we obtained the combined felling date range AD 1549 to 1554 for six of the trees with a 99.7% confidence level. This would allow for a seasoning time of a couple of weeks up to four years, although we cannot discard that some of the other trees were cut earlier and had longer seasoning periods. Interestingly, our research provides evidence that the wood originated from the southwest of Sweden, representing an alternative source to the south-eastern Baltic oak commonly used for panel paintings in northern Europe in the 16th century. This is the first time that such procurement source is reported by dendrochronology in an altarpiece. Wood technological features of the planks and panels are compared to those of Baltic oak wainscots and to contemporary altarpieces in Spain and Portugal. Possible reasons for the use of this alternative procurement source are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {During the Roman period various military structures were build along the limes in the Lower Rhine Region. These military structures were connected with a road. This road hasbeen excavated at various locations. One construction phase of the limes road and related structures was dendrochronologically dated to the autumn or winter of AD 124-125. This phase is probably related to a visit of emperor Hadrian to the region. The dendrochronological material of all contexts from this period shows a striking similarity of the tree ring patterns. This indicates that the wood came from a single region. This region is thought to have been located on the coarse soils between Xanten and Venlo. The timber was thus transported over a distance of approximately one hundred kilometres, making this the earliest example of large-scale long distance timber transport in the Lower Rhine region. The scale of the project justifies the assumption that the Roman state and army were involved. The oaks were most likely transported over water using barges. It should be noted that local wood was also used, indicating that the local woodlands were not yet depleted, but for this large-scale project the Roman army also had to look elsewhere for resources. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The application of tree-ring research to the study of cultural heritage has seen important conceptual and methodological developments in the 21 st century. Following the breakthrough discovery in the 1980s of the importation of timber from the south-eastern Baltic to the Low Countries for panel paintings, the historical timber trade acquired paramount relevance in European dendrochronology. The improvement of methods and tools to locate the area of origin of the wood has since become a focal line of research. Reference chronologies of different variables (ring width, earlywood, latewood, earlywood vessel size in oak, latewood density in conifers, stable isotope chronologies of δ13C, δ18O) are now being developed in areas formerly (and currently) exploited for timber production, and isotopic signatures of 87Sr/86Sr are being mapped to provide a geochemical reference. In parallel, novel techniques to identify wood species (automated wood identification, chemical biomarkers, DNA barcoding) and their application on historical and ancient wood are being explored, given that this could sometimes help narrow down the timber source area. Modern technology is playing a key role in the study of wooden objects through non-invasive methods, and collaboration with (art) historians, mathematicians, engineers and conservators has proven essential in current achievements. Tree-ring series can now be retrieved from high resolution X-ray computed tomography images, allowing the research of otherwise inaccessible pieces. This paper reviews recent advances in those fields (tree-ring based dendroprovenancing, wood species identification, chemical fingerprinting, use of genetic markers, isotopic signatures, and non-invasive methods), and discusses their implementation and challenges in dendroarchaeological studies. © 2020 The Author(s)},

Cedrus sp. forests furnished a great amount of wood in antiquity, for purposes ranging from ship to temple construction, and for fashioning cult statues and sarcophagi. The 87Sr/86Sr signatures of archaeological cedar samples may be compared with the preliminary dataset presented here to help determine the geographic origin of wooden artifacts. Sample sites include two forest areas in the Troodos Massif of Cyprus, five in the Lebanon, and two in Turkey’s Taurus Mountains. Sr ratios for wood varieties (i.e., early heartwood, late heartwood, sapwood, and twig wood) demonstrate relative uniformity between the xylem types frequently recovered from archaeological contexts. As such, this pilot study also assesses important issues of archaeological sampling and the geographical factors that influence Sr uptake in cedar trees of this region. While the regional signatures are distinct in most cases, small sample sizes and range overlap indicate the need for additional methods to make a case for a certain source forest. Alone, this method continues to be best used to disprove assumed wood provenances. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Dendrochronology (tree-ring analysis) allows us to precisely date and identify the origin of timber from historic contexts. However, reference datasets to determine the origin can include timber of non-local origin. Therefore, we have applied Sr isotopic on timbers from three buildings in Jutland, Denmark, mostly dating from the late 16th and early 17th centuries CE to improve and refine the provenance identification. The dendrochronology suggested that some timbers analysed were imported from the Swedish side of Øresund/Kattegat while others were local, and others again might be from south Norway. By adding the Sr isotopic analysis, a far more detailed interpretation of the origin of these timbers can be presented for non-Danish timbers. In this paper we suggest that Danish ports in the provinces of Halland and Skåne played a major role in the timber trade between the Danish and Swedish parts of the Danish kingdom. For Danish timbers dendroprovenancing proved better than Sr isotopic analysis. Furthermore, a small number of Sr isotopic analyses were performed to contribute to the base-line along the Göta-river in Southern-Sweden. © 2023 Van Ham-Meert, Daly.

During excavations at Voorburg-Arentsburg (site Forum Hadriani) in 2007-2008, the wooden quay from the Roman harbour was revealed and 60 oak (Quercus sp.) piles were sampled and analysed by dendrochronology. Hierarchical cluster analysis was employed to group the tree-ring series from the piles according to their affinity, and three object chronologies representing different provenances were obtained. These were compared to a spatial network of archaeological and palaeo-ecological site chronologies from the Netherlands and Germany covering the Roman period. Our research revealed two construction phases in the harbour, which were built with wood from different geographical sources. The oldest phase, dating to ca. AD 160, consists of oak from the southeast of the Netherlands and southern Germany, whereas the second, more recent one, was built in or shortly after AD 205 with oak grown in the catchment basin of the river Mosel. Our results further suggest that scarcity of local timber resources was the reason for the import of wood for the quay at Forum Hadriani, and evidence that the Romans had established a well organised timber distribution network to supply wood over large distances already in the mid-2nd century AD. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Highly regional tree ring variations enable matching some construction timbers to their source. Here, a method is developed which 1) develops a rejection criteria for ruling out sources for a tree ring sequence, 2) quantifies the relative spatial representation of a given source sequence, and 3) applies Bayes theorem to calculate posterior probabilities of source attribution. The application of this method in part supports past sourcing work, but indicates that the majority (59–64%) of timbers cannot be ascribed with even low confidence to the most common high-altitude sources.

	abstract = {Wood has been used by mankind since prehistory; therefore the presence of wood in cultural heritage is huge. The dendrochronological dating is considered one of the principal techniques for the study of wood of historical and architectural interest. When the traces left by the history make a correct reading of the context impossible, the results given by dendrochronology are often the only certain data useful as a reference. Wood species identification and tree-ring analysis allow far more than just dating: often it is possible to identify the provenance of the woods, closely studying some technical aspects, detecting major or minor interventions of restoration, substitution, and reuse, and, in some fields of study, verifying the attribution of the artifact to a certain artist or school. The power of dendrochronology is based on the rigorous scientific approach and the complete independence from other stylistic or historical considerations. © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The value of dendrochronology as a precise dating tool is well established (Ashmore, this volume) and this paper concentrates on other aspects of its value to Scottish archaeology and history. Timber in Scotland has been a resource under pressure for a long time, and consequently the history of timber trade and woodland exploitation is particularly interesting. Scotland now has very restricted semi-natural woodland, representing about 1% of land cover. While the extent of semi-natural woodland has undoubtedly shrunk in recent centuries, pollen evidence indicates that much of Scotland has been characterized by open landscapes since later pre-history (Tipping 1994). Dendrochronology is the principal means by which the history of the exploitation and husbandry of the timber resource can be unravelled. Intrinsic to dendrochronology is its ability to provide information on the date, provenance and quality of timbers, allowing a more sophisticated and precise history to be developed than is possible through other environmental techniques. In this paper, we review the accumulating tree-ring evidence and the light it throws on the history of timber availability and exploitation in Scotland.},

	abstract = {British dendrochronology is based on the analysis of oak, but over the past few years an English Heritage funded research project has been investigating the viability of analysing conifers used in historic contexts. The primary aim of this is to extend the scope of British dendrochronology to incorporate structures built of coniferous timber. The inclusion of three buildings constructed of Scots Pine in tree-ring list 114 shows that this potential is now starting to be realised. In addition, as the majority of medieval and post-medieval conifer timbers used for building are likely to be imported, successful dating has the added advantage of providing information about the source of timber, and hence the trade in timber during these periods. © 2000, Maney Publishing. © 2000, Taylor and Francis Ltd.

	abstract = {Research into the dates of timber used for art‐historical objects has provided a large data set on which to test standard dendrochronological techniques. Some 177 sets of tree‐ring measurements, originally analysed by the late Dr J. M. Fletcher at Oxford University, have been re‐examined independently in the tree‐ring laboratories at the University of Sheffield and the Museum of London Archaeology Service. The results show a high level of agreement between the laboratories. In contrast, many of the dates produced by Dr Fletcher for the paintings are not confirmed. The two different approaches described here also resulted in remarkably similar internal groupings of the dated material. These groupings probably reflect the provenance of the timbers and suggest that two different areas of the eastern Baltic supplied the bulk of the material with smaller quantities of panels originating in Britain and central Europe.
